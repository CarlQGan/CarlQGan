## Carl Gan (Formally Qianxin Gan)

Hiii there :3 

I'm Carl, a programmer (mostly) & hardware designer (slightly) who happens to be a car enthusiast (stubbornly). Sometimes a mechanic (samaritan) that breaks your car to fix my code.

Currently, I am working as a **Quantitative Research Intern** with a passion for technology and a diverse skill set in **Machine Learning**, **Data Analysis**, and **Software Development**. I hold a comprehensive background in **Computer Science**, **Electrical and Computer Engineering**, **Information Science**, **Mechanical Engineering**, and **Business** from my studies.
